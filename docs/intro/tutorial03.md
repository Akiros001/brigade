# Writing your first CI pipeline, Part 3

This tutorial begins where [Tutorial 2][part2] left off. Weâ€™ll walk through the process for configuring your newly created Github repository with Brigade for testing new features. We'll configure a new Brigade project, and have Github push events to trigger Brigade builds.

## Create a Brigade project

The Brigade server tracks separate configuration for each project you set up. To create and manage these configurations, we use the [brig](https://github.com/Azure/brigade/tree/master/brig) cli.

First, to use a Github OAuth token so your Pull Request statuses are updated, do the following:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new and enter your password if prompted
2. Give the token a description, such as `brigade project: uuid-generator`
3. Grant the token full *repo* scope so Brigade can update Pull Request statuses

4. Click *Generate token*
5. Copy the personal access token for use in the next step below. (`mygithubtoken` in this example)

Now, we're ready to create a new project via `brig` and point it to the GitHub project we just created, *uuid-generator*.

Follow the interactive prompts from `brig project create` and fill in the details similar to below:

```console
 $ brig project create
? Project Name bacongobbler/uuid-generator
? Full repository name github.com/bacongobbler/uuid-generator
? Clone URL (https://github.com/your/repo.git) https://github.com/bacongobbler/uuid-generator.git
? Add secrets? No
Auto-generated a Shared Secret: "mDXUDZyDsTUHw4KZIMPOQMN1"
? Configure GitHub Access? Yes
? OAuth2 token mygithubtoken
? GitHub Enterprise URL
? GitHub Enterprise upload URL
? Configure advanced options No
Project ID: brigade-5ea0b3d7707afb5d04d55544485da6aff4f58006c1633f4ae0cb11
```

Note: to explore the advanced options, each prompt offers further info when `?` is entered.

## Configuring Github

We want to build our project each time a new commit is pushed to master, and each time we get a new Pull Request.

To do this, log into your project (substituting *bacongobbler* for your own Github username) on https://github.com/bacongobbler/uuid-generator/settings/hooks.

From your project...

1. On the Webhooks screen, click `Add Webhook`
2. Complete the form:
  - Payload URL should be the URL to your BRIGADE server, adding the github webhook endpoint (e.g. https://brigade.example.com/events/github)
  - Content-Type should be `application/json`
  - Secret should be the shared secret generated by `brig` above (`mDXUDZyDsTUHw4KZIMPOQMN1`)
  - In the radio buttons, choose `Let me select individual events`
    - Select `push` and `pull request`
  - Make sure the `Active` checkbox is selected
  - Click the `Add Webhook` button

To get the IP for your "Payload URL", run this command on your Kubernetes cluster,
and look for the `brigade-github-gw` line:

```console
$ kubectl get service
NAME                        TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
brigade-brigade-api         ClusterIP      10.0.0.57    <none>        7745/TCP         8h
brigade-brigade-github-gw   LoadBalancer   10.0.0.157   10.21.77.9    7744:31946/TCP   8h
```

You will use the `EXTERNAL-IP` address (feel free to map it to a DNS name if you wish):
`http://10.21.77.9:7744/events/github`

The next time you push to the repository, the webhook system should trigger a build.

After configuring Brigade to test new features, read [part 4 of this tutorial][part4] to write a new feature to the uuid-generator project, which will trigger a test build using Brigade.
